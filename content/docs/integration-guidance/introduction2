Integration is available as two options:
* With support of [SDK](#sdk)
* Custom implementation of [T-0 protocol](#protocols)

## Authentication
To securely identify providers in the network, T-0 uses a mechanism of request signatures similar to how blockchains are doing this.
Every request from the provider to the network and from the network to provider must have a special set of headers which ensures the originator of the request.
Every provider should:
1. Generate the public/private key pay

   TODO: document an example of how to generate private/public key-pair
2. Register generated public key in the network
3. Receive public key of the network
4. Configure SDK (or custom protocol implementation) to
    1. Sign requests to the network with provider's private key
    2. Validate signature of incoming requests from the network against the network's public key

## API Endpoints
* Production: `https://api.t-0.network`
* Test: `https://tbd.t-0.network`

## SDK
Publicly available SDKs:
* Golang (https://github.com/t-0-network/provider-sdk-go)

SDKs for other tech stacks (NodeJS, Java etc.) are available by request

## Protocols
* GRPC (preferred)
* JSON
