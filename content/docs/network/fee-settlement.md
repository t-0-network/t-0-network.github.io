The T-0 Network implements a transparent fee structure that charges both pay-in and payout providers a 0.05% fee based on the USD equivalent of each transaction. This symmetrical fee approach ensures fair cost distribution across all network participants while maintaining competitive pricing for end users.

Fee collection occurs automatically during payment processing, with fees recorded in the network's accounting ledger as part of each transaction. The network maintains detailed fee accounting for each provider, enabling transparent reporting and reconciliation. Fee settlement follows the same blockchain-based approach used for credit settlement, with providers periodically settling accumulated fees through USDT transfers to network-designated addresses.

This fee structure supports the network's operational costs while providing predictable pricing for providers to incorporate into their own fee calculations. The automated fee collection and settlement process eliminates the administrative overhead typically associated with network fee management in traditional payment systems.
